The "assignment3a.R" file was developed using R 3.4.1. When you execute the file 
it will create the tab delimited table of numbers for the assignment and save it
as a file called "numbers.txt" in the working directory. Then it will read in 
that file, multiply the numbers by 5, and write the values in a tab-delimitted
file called "numbers_multiplied.txt".

The "assignment3b.R" file was also developed using R 3.4.1. When you run the
file, it will check to see if you have the ggplot2 package available, and if 
not it will download it. The "numbers.txt" file is read in as a matrix. An
apply statement is used to get t-test and Wilcox-test outputs for every 
combination of row-pairs. Box plots are generated using ggplot2.
